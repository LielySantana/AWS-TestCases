 * list-buckets.test.ts

 * Unit tests for the list-buckets Lambda handler function.
 *
 * As the entry point for getting our bucket list, the handler is the seam (or
 * interface) between the service integration calling the lambda - in this case
 * Amazon API Gateway - and the inner business logic of the application.
 *
 * The unit tests here are focused on testing this interface, exercising code
 * paths that validate inbound request payloads and checking for correct
 * behavior when the busines layer returns different results.
